meta:
- when should we attack?
  - simple timing?
  - army value?
  - life cycle stage?
- confidence level?
- decide on what will be the overlying index to determine actions at any given time
  - if this is the case then we simply need to set target values in econ, units, composition, upgrades etc
  - what if we went with time to kill?
    - how fast we can destroy and army with value of x
- mobility?
- hit & run?

- when it comes to attacking, is it possible to use pattern based when it comes to attacking
    - flanking maneuvers possible? or is it just too complex?
