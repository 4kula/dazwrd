- when should we attack?
  - simple timing?
  - army value?
  - life cycle stage?
- confidence level?

  - if this is the case then we simply need to set target values in econ, units, composition, upgrades etc
  - what if we went with time to kill?
    - how fast we can destroy and army with value of x
- mobility?
- hit & run?
